# pysg

Simple and lightweight 3D render scene graph for python 3.

## TODO

Right now pysg is under construction and not ready for usage yet. This is a list of things that still need to be done:

- [ ] Doc
	- [ ] Static pages 
	- [x] Setup autodoc with SPHINX
	- [ ] Add to readthedocs.io
- [ ] Static typing for most function calls and methods
- [ ] Make pip package
- [ ] Examples

## Documentation

[Link to online documentation](https://pysg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Dependencies

* [ModernGL](https://github.com/cprogrammer1994/ModernGL) - OpenGL related stuff.
* [pyrr](https://github.com/adamlwgriffiths/Pyrr) - Math operations in 3D like matrix multiplication etc.. Fast due to the heavy use of [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/).

<!-- 
## Installing

The pysg package can be installed using pip. Please note that a python version >=3.6 is required since the static type checking feature is used.

TODO: make sure pysg is in pip

```
pip install pysg
```

## Running the tests

TODO

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
